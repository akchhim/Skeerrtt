King Tire CO. has been serving Jackson Tn for many years and still going on through till today. King tire has came a long way from the bottom to the top. On our website we want you to look at it and think how much King Tire CO. tries to get you what you need. King Tire is actually a people workshop also they have coffee for their constumer's but that's not all they we give you a laugh also. In the colors of the website we just went with there scheme colors which was black and yellow. Also we wanted to keep it simple so we would make it visible to our constumers and show them we care about making the website look very good and clean and not be messy so they can get to whatever they need on our page. 

King Tire Co. has come a long way from its beginnings to be the top auto repair and service shop in Jackson and Humboldt. When we first started, it was a passion for a better tire buying and auto repair experience, which drove us to develop the model of King Tire Co. and gave us the conviction to turn hard work and inspiration into to a booming tire and auto repair provider. We now serve customers all over Tennessee and are thrilled to be a part of your family's trusted brands for all auto repair and tire needs.

We offer many ways to get you in and out. We belive in working and having fun we dont like having strict and very serious people around because we say when a constumer is smiling they will come back. We offer coffee in the building also idf if your looking for a nice fresh warm cup of coffee. Our service is very fast pace and its very important we keep going so we can make the best out of ourselves and our bussiness.Last but not least our workers are all around the world and we train our workers to the max so we can know they really are build for the job.
